# The Interactive Online References for PhonoSapiens
Team PhonoSapiens - Paul Dean, Soo Bin Hwang and Seung Hwa Jun

## Overview
This web app allows a designated author to list references for the book titled **<em>Phono Sapiens Economics: The New Human-Centered Digital Economy</em>** written by Seung Hwa Jun. Users can browse and filter references by keywords and which chapter the reference is cited. The app also utilizes a Python Flask app that scrapes related keywords from various websites and lists the most recent articles containing those keywords. The app is primarily written in JavaScript and uses the D3 library for key visualization. Visit this [page](https://github.com/soobing91/P3_PhonoSapiens_References/blob/master/Presentation%20PPT/PhonoSapiens%20Team%20PPT_Merged%20Final.pdf) for the detailed outlook of the app.
